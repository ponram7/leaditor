# Lead Generation App (Leaditor)

Leaditor is a web-based application designed for managing leads, primarily for businesses that generate and track potential customer information. Built using Django, bootstrap, and HTMX, the app offers an interactive and dynamic experience for users to manage their lead data.

## Features

- **Lead Management**: Create, view, and update lead information (e.g., name, email, phone, company, and status).
- **Dynamic UI**: The application is powered by HTMX, allowing dynamic interactions like loading and updating lead data without page reloads.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS ensures the app is fully responsive and provides a modern user interface.
- **Admin Interface**: Easily manage leads via the built-in Django admin panel.
- **SQLite Database**: Uses SQLite for easy local development and testing.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Frontend**: bootstrap
- **Database**: SQLite (can be switched to PostgreSQL or MySQL)
- **Development Tools**: Python, pip, virtualenv

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- virtualenv (for creating isolated environments)

### Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/leaditor.git
   cd leaditor
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:

bash
Copy
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:

bash
Copy
source venv/bin/activate
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make migrations to create the database schema:

bash
Copy
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
Create a superuser to access the Django admin panel:

bash
Copy
python manage.py createsuperuser
Run the development server:

bash
Copy
python manage.py runserver
Access the app:

Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/
The Django admin panel is available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

Development Notes
Adding New Leads: You can add new leads via the Django admin interface or by creating forms that are linked to your Lead model in the frontend views.
HTMX: HTMX is used for adding interactivity to the app, such as dynamically loading leads or updating a lead’s status without requiring full-page refreshes.
Tailwind CSS: Tailwind helps with building a responsive UI. Make sure to adjust the layout and styles as needed for your app’s requirements.
